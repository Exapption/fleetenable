        conflict of law principles.
    </p>

    <h3>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h3>
    <h4>Informal
        Negotiations</h4>
    <p class="common_style">To
        expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy,
        or claim related to these Terms of Use (each a &quot;Dispute&quot;
        and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us
        (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”),
        the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except
        those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at
        least&nbsp;thirty (30)&nbsp;days before initiating arbitration. Such
        informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to
        the other Party.
    </p>
    <h4>Binding Arbitration</h4>
    <p class="common_style">If
        the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal
        negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded
        below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding
        arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD
        HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration
        shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration
        Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) and,
        where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
        Related Disputes (&quot;AAA Consumer Rules&quot;), both of which are
        available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and
        your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA
        Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer
        Rules.&nbsp;If such costs are determined to by the arbitrator to be
        excessive, we will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.&nbsp;The
        arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of
        documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision
        in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless
        requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law,
        and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.
        Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or
        applicable law, the arbitration will take place in&nbsp;Travis
        County,&nbsp;Texas. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties
        may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending
        arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the
        award entered by the arbitrator.
    </p>
    <p class="common_style">If
        for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration,
        the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal
        courts located in&nbsp;New Castle County&nbsp;,&nbsp;Delaware, and
        the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of
        personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue
        and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.&nbsp;Application
        of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
        Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act
        (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.
    </p>
    <p class="common_style">In
        no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way
        to the Site or Service be commenced more than&nbsp;one (1)&nbsp;years
        after the cause of action arose.&nbsp;If this provision is found to
        be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to
        arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision
        found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be
        decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed
        for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the
        personal jurisdiction of that court.
    </p>
    <h4>Restrictions</h4>
    <p class="common_style">The
        Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
        between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by
        law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding;
        (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated
        on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and
        (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a
        purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or
        any other persons.
    </p>
    <h4>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and
        Arbitration</h4>
    </p>
    <p class="common_style">The
        Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
        above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding
        arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or
        concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights
        of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations
        of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c)
        any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be
        illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate
        any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be
        illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court
        of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction
        above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction
        of that court.

        <p class="common_style">Most
            web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
            applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting
            you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
            about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No
            uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
            signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
            DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
            communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
            online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
            inform you about that practice in a revised version of this&nbsp;privacy
